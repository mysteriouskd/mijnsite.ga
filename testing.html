<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>You are truly amazing you know that right? Probably not but that is ok that's why i'm still around. You are beautiful, you are amazing and when you are happy it can truly brighten up even the darkest of nights :you know that right? Well if not I d. I know sometimes the world seems like it is closing in on itself, like there is no where to run, like you're running out of time but it never truly is it is like an optical illusion that the longer you stare at it the worse it looks and sometimes you just need to step back and look at everything around the illusion to see the truth, that it is just an illusion. Life might be hard but it won't always be, there are people willing to help even if it might not seem like it, not every problem can be fixed and not everyone can help with those problems..... But they can try and help make your problems seem less scary and worrying. I know you are scared, I know you might be stuck, but no matter how dark you think it is that doesn't mean it can't be bright again.
